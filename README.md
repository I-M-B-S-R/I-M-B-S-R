- 👋 Hi, I’m @I-M-B-S-R.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Brian_Scott_Reynolds@Yahoo.Com.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... I am a 59 year old "Married Man," I have been "Maired" for 39 years, and counting!
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... you are never to old to learn or to teach. And I am an inventor, engineer and fabricator of mechanical devices and processes. I have taken some of my inventions all the way to market. I have experience in, and have (or built) tools for most of the trades like plumbing, electrical, mechanical, landscaping, etc. But now I am disabled from a “Broken Back.” I can hardly walk any more. My Wife (Of 39 Years) and I are financially “POOR” now, because at the time I first became disabled, it was not apparent as to what was causing the “Taser Like Shocks” that I was getting (NOTE: I was a Deputy Sheriff for 7.5 years, and during that time I was “Tasered” two times in trainings, so, I consider myself to be an authority on what it feels like to be “Tasered!” And the “Shocks” that I was getting, felt just like I was being “Tasered” yet again, and again, and again, several times a day, and at night (24 / 7) each time it lasted from 1 to 3 seconds, and as time went by they became even more frequent before a surgeons assistant discovered that my back bones were actually shifting between L4 and L5 pinching my Spinal Cord! So, they fused my back, and it helped till one of the defective bolts that broke inside the bone at the time they put it in, also broke two more times dropping a piece of broken bolt down into a “Never Cluster” causing me some “Paralysis” in my legs! (That is why it is so hard for me to walk!)
